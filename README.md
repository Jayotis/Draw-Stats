# Draw-Stats
Number combination probability generator.

Functions for generating number combination probabitlies.

The intention of this block of code is to explore several probability algorithms and use them on statistical data gathered from real world random events. The goal is to filter out the most improbable outcomes and have only a small basket of highly probable outcomes. Events like a repeated combination of numbers event are filtered out but since that is a possibility then the real outcome will be filtered out and in most cases the actual combination is removed.

That said, the code does what is intended and expected. It creates every 6/49 combination and eliminates uncommon combos based on some basic rules made from common observations of past draws. It also scans a database of past draws, which are in draw order, and builds a probability construct. The reason for draw order is due to calculating probability based on a per attempt draw from a set containing itself; meaning it is not based on a per draw day total. To explain this further, lets say the following numbers are drawn 3, 8, 48, 22, 39, 1. Instead of saying 39 happened once in 1 draws it can be said 39 was drawn once after 5 draws due to 3, 8, 48, 22, being drawn before the attempt that resulted in 39 being selected. Subsequent draws will no longer contain a set with 39 included and therefore not counted against that number. All remaining numbers would have 6 draw attempts and 0 successful attempts. This is done to gather a larger scope of data for calculations and used against a running global probability attempt counter used in correlating probability. Making only one ticket purchase a draw for several months showed a minor increase in small prize payouts and if I was to guess I would say the odds of winning increase by maybe 1-2%. The point of this project was not to win the lottery but to explore some ideas about probability and keep my coding skills active... and OK, it was fun!

I have uploaded the compressed data file with prebuilt combinations(Basefile.dat) and the past draws(PastDraws.csv) in draw order. I built the past draws file from a pdf sent to me from the people who run the Loto649 in Canada. After creating the file I had to manually input new draws after watching the results as the company did not publish draw order results regularly. The file is out of date and requires several years of draws to be added.
